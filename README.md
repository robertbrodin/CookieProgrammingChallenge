# CookieProgrammingChallenge

Hello!

My name is Rob, and I am pleased to share what I have programmed.

To run the shell script for the cookie program, first do (if on Unix system):
chmod +x most_active_cookie

After running that, you can then run a command in the following format:
./most_active_cookie csvFile -d date
Example: ./most_active_cookie cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-08

If you would like to run the test cases I wrote, please run:
chmod +x run_test_cases
./run_test_cases

Thank you! If you have any issues with running the code please email me at rbrodin@wpi.edu
